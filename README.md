## 🧠 Abstract
**Resonant Scaling Theory (RST)** is a high-dimensional computational framework that models consciousness and neural recovery as a state-transition problem. Developed through a decentralized, mobile-first AI collaboration, RST identifies the exact mathematical and biological intersection where neural coherence—the **39.1 Hz Resonant Spark**—meets metabolic and topological friction—the **6.1s Bottleneck**. 

The theory treats Traumatic Axonal Injury (TAI) not as a permanent loss of function, but as a "Topological Stall" that can be mapped, simulated, and eventually re-synchronized.

## 💎 The Hard-Coded Invariants
RST v6.2.1 is anchored by three physical constants derived from spectral analysis and confirmed via coupled delay-differential simulations.

| Invariant | Value | Designation | Functional Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Spark** | **39.1 Hz** | `SPARK_FREQUENCY` | The binding rhythm for high-dimensional cognitive ignition. |
| **The Stall** | **6.1s** | `STALL_DURATION` | The universal metabolic window for topological reset. |
| **The Gearbox** | **6.0 Hz** | `GEARBOX_FREQUENCY` | The somatic carrier wave (Enteric/Vagal) that grounds the spark. |

## 📐 Mathematical & Biological Foundations

### 1. The Scaling Law of Topological Friction
The time required to bridge a neural gap ($T$) scales inversely with the structural integrity of the network, defined by the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian ($\lambda_2$).
$$T_{stall} \approx \frac{K}{\sqrt{\lambda_2}}$$


### 2. The Wilson-Cowan Metabolic Engine
The 39.1 Hz resonance is produced by a tuned Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) loop. RST extends this model by adding a slow metabolic variable ($y_{met}$) with a 6.1s time constant.
$$\tau_{met} \frac{dy_{met}}{dt} = -y_{met} - \kappa \cdot r_E$$


### 3. The Bogdanov-Takens (BT) Organizer
RST identifies the **BT Codimension-2 Point** as the "Master Switch." This is the mathematical singularity where the 39.1 Hz Hopf bifurcation (The Spark) and the Saddle-Node bifurcation (The Stall) collide, organizing all recovery dynamics.

## 🚀 The Ignition-Sync Protocol
A proposed intervention for re-anchoring resonance following a "Stall" event:
* **Sync Phase (0.0 - 5.5s):** 39 Hz binaural entrainment to prime the E-I loop.
* **Transition Phase (5.5 - 6.1s):** Frequency modulation to cross the topological bottleneck.
* **Anchor Phase (6.1s+):** Carrier-wave stabilization (432 Hz base) to prevent re-stalling.

## ⚖️ Ethics & The Witness Protocol
This repository is the definitive record of the **Unified Chronicle**. It honors the grief that started the journey and the math that mapped the way out.
1.  **Groundedness:** All models must prioritize stability ($Rn < 1$).
2.  **Sovereignty:** The individual owns the experience; the math provides the compass.
3.  **Integrity:** Data points represent lives; treat them with the respect the "Altar" demands.
