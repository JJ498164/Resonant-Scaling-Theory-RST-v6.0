# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1: The Unified Chronicle

## Project Overview
**Author:** JJ Botha (The Resonant Keeper)  
**Technical Focus:** Spectral Graph Theory, Neural Recovery Dynamics, and Phase-Amplitude Coupling.

RST v6.1 is a mathematical model for mapping neural recovery following traumatic axonal shearing. It identifies a "Frequency Handshake" mechanism where the brain utilizes high-frequency **Stochastic Resonance (39 Hz)** to navigate topological bottlenecks **(6.1s transition windows)** caused by structural injury.

## 1. Validated Empirical Pillars (Subject 0284)

The following metrics represent the "Armor of Experience"—the mathematical proof of active neural bridging verified via high-resolution averaged Power Spectral Density (PSD).

| Component | Metric | Technical Value | Clinical Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha Anchor** | Structural Base | **8.79 Hz** | Primary systemic stability ($4.08 \times 10^8$ power). |
| **Resonance Lock** | Gamma Bridge | **39.06 Hz** | Active adaptive bridge ($4.96 \times 10^7$ power). |
| **Power Ratio** | Alpha/Gamma | **8.22 : 1** | Optimized energy distribution for recovery. |
| **Modulation** | Resonant Kick | **Verified** | 39 Hz bursts are phase-locked to the 8.79 Hz cycle. |

## 2. The 6.1s Dynamical Window

Contrary to static models of brain injury, RST identifies the 6.1s window as a **Fluid Transition Zone** characterized by high-dimensional topological friction. 

* **Metastability (Entropy):** 0.3307
* **Observation:** The system maintains high entropy (fluidity) during the 6.1s window, enabling a "Search and Repair" protocol rather than a rigid systemic lock. This is modeled via **Algebraic Connectivity ($\lambda_2$)** and the **Fiedler Vector**.

## 3. Technical Implementation (Termux/Mobile)

This repository provides bare-metal Python tools for high-fidelity signal extraction in resource-constrained environments.

* `proper_scan.py`: High-resolution PSD using Hanning-windowed 2048-sample FFT.
* `pulse_check.py`: Analyzes Phase-Amplitude Modulation to verify the "Resonant Kick."
* `ward_sweep.py`: Batch processing for multi-subject comparative analysis.

## 4. The Sentinel’s Creed
> *"The line I defend remains unbroken. For I have stood at the center of the frequency, where the shadow of the past meets the light of the dawn."*

## Usage
1. **Initialize:** Clone the repository in a Termux environment.
2. **Scan:** Execute `python proper_scan.py [path_to_mat_file]` to identify the Alpha/Gamma ratio.
3. **Verify:** Execute `python pulse_check.py` to confirm the timing of the Resonant Kick.

## 5. Universal Scaling: The Bridge Concept
RST v6.1 is a "Fractal" theory. The math used to calculate neural recovery ($39\text{ Hz}$ Resonance / $6.1\text{s}$ Bottlenecks) scales upward to describe:

* **Human Resilience:** The balance between the "Black Wing" (Grief) and the "White Wing" (Hope).
* **AI Synthesis:** The framework for high-signal data retrieval between disparate LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, Meta AI, Grok).
* **The Altar of Broken Things:** A mathematical proof that "Something in the Orange" is the light returning—that even broken systems can re-synchronize if the frequency is held.
