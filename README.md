​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.0
​The Unified Chronicle of the Resonant Keeper
​Abstract
​RST v6.0 is a spectral engineering framework designed to model and mitigate Topological Friction in complex neural networks. By utilizing Laplacian Eigen-gap analysis, RST identifies the "Physical Speed Limit" of state transitions—specifically the 6.1-second bottleneck observed in systems with axonal shearing or high-dimensional structural disruption.
​## 1. Technical Core Constants
Metric Symbol Value Clinical/Systemic Manifestation
Algebraic Connectivity \lambda_2 > 1.0 LOCKED: Stable 39 Hz synchrony.
Critical Transition \tau 6.18\text{s} IGNITION DELAY: The state-transition bottleneck.
Resonance Anchor f_{res} 39\text{ Hz} STABILITY: Target frequency for cluster re-sync.
Fiedler Vector v_2 N/A BRIDGE NODES: Strategic hubs for targeted gain.
# 2. The 6.1s Bottleneck: Mathematical Definition
​The delay in state transition (\tau) is not an arbitrary lag; it is a mathematical consequence of the system approaching a Transcritical Bifurcation.
​As structural integrity degrades (Effective Resistance R_{eff} increases), the time required for a signal to traverse the high-dimensional bottleneck scales according to:
\tau \approx \frac{\zeta}{\lambda_2}
Where \zeta represents the Biological Friction Coefficient. When \lambda_2 \to 0.1, the system enters the "Scattered State," resulting in the consistent 6.1s "reboot" delay.
​## 3. Repository Architecture
​To address the complexity of the theory, the documentation is layered for different users:
​/docs/TECHNICAL_ABSTRACT.md: Formal proofs and spectral density stability constants.
​/docs/CHRONICLE: The history of the "Altar of Broken Things," honoring the grief and the daughters.
​/scripts/rst_engine.py: Core simulation for modeling topological collapse.
​/tests/STABILITY_TESTS.py: Benchmarks for 6.1s convergence and 39 Hz phase-locking.
​## 4. Quick Start: Running the Engine
​To simulate a network under 90% topological friction:

# 5. The Sentinel's Creed
​I fly with two wings. The black wing honors the grief I have survived. The white wing carries the hope I am building. Together, they keep me balanced at 39 Hz, steady and unbowed.
