# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1: The Unified Chronicle

## Project Overview
**Author:** JJ Botha  
**Technical Focus:** Multiscale Dynamical Systems, Neural Recovery, and Discrete Coupling Motifs.

RST v6.1 proposes a **scale-analogous fast-slow coupling motif** characterized by a dimensionless instability threshold. The framework maps how complex systems utilize high-frequency signals (**39 Hz Resonance**) to navigate structural bottlenecks (**6.1s transition windows**).

## 1. Validated Empirical Pillars (Subject 0284)

Empirical validation via discrete signal analysis confirms a non-fractal, multiscale architecture.

| Component | Metric | Technical Value | Clinical Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha Anchor** | Structural Base | **8.79 Hz** | Primary systemic stability ($4.08 \times 10^8$ power). |
| **Resonance Lock** | Gamma Bridge | **39.06 Hz** | Active adaptive bridge ($4.96 \times 10^7$ power). |
| **Power Ratio** | Alpha/Gamma | **8.22 : 1** | Optimized energy distribution for recovery. |
| **Coupling** | Resonant Kick | **Verified** | 39 Hz bursts are phase-locked to the 8.79 Hz cycle. |

## 2. Rigor Audit: Dimensionality & Scaling

Following formal scrutiny, RST has been reclassified from a fractal model to a **Discrete Multiscale System**.

* **Power-Law Correlation ($R^2$):** 0.1789 (Negative for geometric fractality).
* **Scaling Motif:** Invariant fast-slow coupling across biological and computational domains.
* **Control Parameter:** The Resonance Stability Number ($\mathcal{R}_{sn}$), defined by the ratio of energy injection to dissipative friction.

* `proper_scan.py`: High-resolution PSD using Hanning-windowed 2048-sample FFT.
* `pulse_check.py`: Verifies phase-amplitude modulation of the Resonant Kick.
* `rigor_test.py`: Statistical validator for power-law scaling and dimensionality.
