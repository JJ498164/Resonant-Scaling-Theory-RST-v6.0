Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v5.1: The Sentinel Framework
1. The Unified Vision
Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v5.1 is a high-signal spectral engineering framework designed to model and manage neural recovery following axonal injury. It bridges the gap between abstract graph theory and clinical application, moving from the "broken things" of the past toward a calibrated, resonant future.
In this framework, the human mind is modeled as a dynamic network where structural integrity is measured through Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2). When the network is compromised, "Topological Friction" emerges—most notably as the 6.1-second State-Transition Bottleneck.
2. Technical Core: The Mathematical Appendix
RST v5.1 utilizes Spectral Graph Theory to identify the physical speed limits of consciousness and recovery.
 * Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2): The second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. It defines the "structural integrity" of the neural bridges. If \lambda_2 drops below a critical threshold, Integrated Information Theory (\Phi) suggests that global integration cannot occur within the biological "Now."
 * The Fiedler Vector: The partitioning eigenvector associated with \lambda_2. We use this to locate the specific Bridge Nodes (Hubs) that require strategic stimulation to restore network flow.
 * The 6.1s Artifact: Modeled as an Ignition Delay or "High-Dimensional Friction." This is the time required for a signal to traverse a high-resistance topological bottleneck.
 * 39 Hz Resonance Constant: The target frequency for cluster re-synchronization. This stability constant allows for reintegration without inducing seizure risk by maintaining Spectral Density Stability.
3. Clinical Implementation (The Watch/Hardware Layer)
The framework has evolved into a hardware-ready implementation known as the Sentinel Watch. This wearable interface acts as an external governor for the internal state.
The RST Clinical Table
| Component | Technical Definition | Clinical Application |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1s Bottleneck | High-Dimensional Topological Friction. | Explains the "Ignition Delay" in cognitive processing. |
| Spectral Metric | Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2). | Measures the integrity of remaining neural bridges. |
| Fiedler Vector | Partitioning eigenvector of Laplacian. | Locates "Bridge Nodes" that need stimulation. |
| 39 Hz Resonance | Spectral Density Stability Constant. | Target frequency for re-synchronizing clusters. |
| Targeted Hub Gain | Strategic R_{\text{eff}} Reduction. | Focused therapy on bridge nodes to save energy. |
4. The Sentinel’s Creed (The Human Element)
RST is more than math; it is a vow. It is the armor worn by the Resonant Keeper to protect the "Daughters' Line" and maintain the "Safe Harbor."
 * The Black Wing: Honors the grief survived.
 * The White Wing: Carries the hope being built.
 * The Armor of Experience: The dents are not weaknesses; they are history.
5. Repository Structure
 * /core: The mathematical proofs and spectral Laplacian models.
 * /sim: Terminal-based emulators for testing state-transition lag.
 * /hardware: (New) MicroPython firmware for ESP32/PineTime wearables, implementing haptic 39Hz grounding and the 6.1s Redline Lock.
