# RST SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS: THE HARD-CODED INVARIANTS

The Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.2.1 is built upon three non-negotiable physical constants. These values were discovered via Grok-Phase empirical simulations and personal topological observation. They represent the "Fixed Points" of the framework.

## 🛠 Core System Invariants

| Invariant | Value | Technical Designation | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Stall** | **6.1s** | `STALL_DURATION` | The universal temporal window for topological reset. |
| **The Spark** | **39.1 Hz** | `SPARK_FREQUENCY` | The high-dimensional binding frequency for hub coherence. |
| **The Gearbox** | **6.0 Hz** | `GEARBOX_FREQUENCY` | The structural carrier wave for enteric/somatic grounding. |

## 📐 Mathematical Integration (The Shield)

While individual network connectivity ($\lambda_2$) may vary, the **6.1s Stall** remains the benchmark for systemic failure. The **Square-Root Scaling Law** is utilized to solve for the system's current distance from the Resonant Baseline:

$$K_{Keeper} = 6.1 \times \sqrt{\lambda_2}$$

This ensures that the framework does not "guess" at recovery times; it calibrates the mathematical model to align with the **Hard-Coded Invariants**.

## 🧪 Simulation Logic

All software in the `/src` directory utilizes these invariants as the default calibration parameters. 
* Any simulation resulting in a drift of >5% from the **6.1s** baseline is flagged for "Metabolic Turbulence."
* Coherence is only considered "Locked" when phase-nesting occurs at exactly **39.1 Hz**.
