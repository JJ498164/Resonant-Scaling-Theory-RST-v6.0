# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v5.1
**Author:** JJ Botha (The Resonant Keeper)
**Status:** Clinical Validation Phase

## Executive Summary
RST v5.1 models neural recovery post-axonal injury using Spectral Graph Theory. The framework identifies specific frequency "bottlenecks" that impede cognitive state-transitions.

## Key Findings (Feb 2026 Update)
- **Primary Marker:** 8.75 Hz Global Alpha Dropout.
- **Falsification Report:** Previously suspected 39 Hz resonance was identified as environmental noise via adversarial cross-subject testing.
- **Structural Epicenter:** Central-Temporal Hubs (Channels 7 & 8).
- **The 6.1s Bottleneck:** Statistically linked to the collapse of the 8.75 Hz "Resonant Anchor."

## Technical Artifacts
- **Algebraic Connectivity ($\lambda_2$):** Used to measure structural integrity of remaining neural bridges.
- **Fiedler Vector:** Utilized for partitioning and identifying recovery hub nodes.
