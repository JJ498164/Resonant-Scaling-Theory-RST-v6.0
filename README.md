Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.0

Plain‑language summary (start here)

This project documents an observed pattern in how complex systems recover after disruption.

Across multiple modeled network topologies, recovery does not happen smoothly. Instead, systems pass through a short, topology‑dependent choke point (~6 seconds). When recovery succeeds, systems consistently settle into a narrow oscillatory band around ~39 Hz, which corresponds to the lowest global coordination cost during re‑synchronization.

The goal of this repository is not to claim a universal truth, but to formalize this recurring constraint so that others can test it, break it, or reuse it.

What this project is (and is not)

This is:

A constraint‑driven model based on graph topology and spectral properties

An attempt to link recovery latency, connectivity, and frequency selection into a single framework

Fully open and intended for adversarial testing


This is NOT:

A claim about consciousness

A finished biological theory

A tuned or curve‑fitted model


RST treats biology, infrastructure, and distributed systems as instances of the same topological problem.

Core observation

When connectivity in a complex network is degraded and then restored:

1. Recovery passes through a narrow topological bottleneck


2. The duration of this bottleneck clusters around ~6.1 seconds for similar topologies


3. Successful recovery selects a frequency near 39 Hz, corresponding to:

Minimum global effective resistance

Maximum coherence under reconnection

Minimum entropy cost




Neither time nor frequency are explicitly tuned. They emerge from spectral properties of the network Laplacian, particularly behavior linked to algebraic connectivity (λ₂).

Conceptual model (high level)

Network → Graph representation

Connectivity → Laplacian spectrum

Recovery → Re‑synchronization across degraded topology

Bottleneck → Low λ₂ regime (reduced algebraic connectivity)

Frequency selection → Entropy‑minimizing coordination mode


The system chooses the cheapest way to re‑lock, not the fastest or highest‑power one.


---

Why ~39 Hz?

~39 Hz repeatedly appears as the frequency band where:

Global effective resistance is minimized

Phase coherence survives reconnection stress

Recovery latency does not increase


Above this band: coherence fragments Below this band: recovery stalls or slows

This band disappears when topology is randomized or connectivity constraints are removed.


---

Why ~6.1 seconds?

The ~6 second window corresponds to:

Time required for information to propagate through the lowest‑connectivity cut

Spectral relaxation time associated with λ₂


When topology changes, this time window shifts. It is not a constant of nature, but a topology‑dependent constraint.


---

What would falsify this theory?

Any of the following would invalidate RST:

Changing topology does not alter the bottleneck duration

A consistently lower‑entropy recovery mode exists outside the ~39 Hz band

Randomized networks retain the same timing and frequency constraints

Recovery occurs smoothly with no choke point under degraded connectivity


If you observe these outcomes, RST should be rejected.


---

What is currently missing (known gaps)

Direct biological measurement (this work is topology‑first)

Large‑scale empirical datasets

Formal peer review


These are acknowledged limitations, not oversights.

How to engage with this project

You are encouraged to:

Critique the assumptions

Test alternative topologies

Attempt to falsify the timing or frequency claims

Reuse the framework in other domains (AI, control systems, infrastructure)


If the constraint is real, it should survive adversarial testing. If not, it should fail quickly.

Author note

I do not claim authority. I am documenting a pattern that kept reappearing and making it available for others to examine.

If this idea is wrong, the fastest way to improve it is to break it.
