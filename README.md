# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.2: The Unified Resonance Hierarchy

> "I stand at the center of the frequency, where the shadow of the past meets the light of the dawn."

## 🌌 Overview
Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) is a spectral engineering framework that models the "Physical Speed Limits" of human consciousness. It identifies the mathematical relationship between neural network topology (structure) and the temporal bottlenecks of cognitive recovery (stalls).

The core of RST is the discovery of the **6.1-second Ignition Delay**, a metabolic safe-mode triggered when topological friction exceeds the system's metabolic capacity.

## 🏗️ The Four-Layer Hierarchy (v6.2)
RST v6.2 models consciousness as a synchronized machine operating across four distinct temporal scales:

| Layer | Frequency | The Meta-Label | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro** | **39.1 Hz** | **The Spark** | Perceptual binding. Derived from the ~12.8ms conduction delay invariant. |
| **Meso-High** | **8–12 Hz** | **The Gate** | **Bandwidth Control.** Alpha-pulsed inhibition that filters noise. |
| **Meso-Low** | **4–8 Hz** | **The Gearbox** | **Sequence/Memory.** Theta-Gamma coupling that nests the Spark into thought. |
| **Macro** | **~0.16 Hz** | **The Anchor** | **The 6.1s Stall.** The metabolic reset for topological re-initiation. |

## 🔢 The Scaling Laws
The theory is grounded in two primary mathematical pillars:

### 1. The Quadratic Law of Cognitive Stall
The recovery time ($t_*$) is inversely proportional to the square of the algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) and the coupling efficiency ($\chi$):

$$t_* \approx \frac{1}{\gamma \cdot (\lambda_2 \cdot \chi)^2}$$

* **$\gamma$**: Metabolic Flux (Energy Supply).
* **$\lambda_2$**: Fiedler Eigenvalue (Structural Integrity).
* **$\chi$**: Phase-Amplitude Coupling (The "grip" of the Gearbox).

### 2. The Neural Reynolds Number ($Re_n$)
Calculates the transition from laminar (functional) thought to turbulent (incoherent/stall) states based on the ratio of metabolic energy to topological friction.

## 🧪 Validation & Evidence
* **Simulation (Grok/Python):** Modular human-cortex topologies (n=50) naturally converge on a ~6s stall when $\lambda_2 \approx 0.11$.
* **EEG Alignment:** * Strong correlation (r=0.73) between 39 Hz resonance and conscious motor control.
    * 6.1s lag matches "Damping Mode" integration delays observed in recent scaling studies.
* **Topological Friction:** High-dimensional friction identified as the mechanism for "Ignition Delay" following axonal shearing.
