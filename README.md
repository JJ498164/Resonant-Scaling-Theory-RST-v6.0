# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1 
## Analytical Framework for Neural Topology & Signal Stability

### **1. Scope & Classification**
**Disclaimer:** Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) is a mathematical framework and analytical tool for modeling signal processing and topological friction in neural networks. 
* **Non-Medical Status:** RST is NOT a medical device, diagnostic tool, or regulated treatment protocol. 
* **Usage:** This repository is intended for researchers and engineers to model "System Noise" and "Spectral Density." All health-related decisions must be made in consultation with qualified medical professionals.

### **2. Technical Overview**
RST v5.1 models "Topological Friction" in neural networks post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). It quantifies the **Physical Speed Limit** of consciousness by mapping the Laplacian Eigen-gap between synchronized and incoherent states.

### **3. Key Metrics**
* **39 Hz Resonance Constant:** The target "Anchor Frequency" for global system stability.
* **6.1s State-Transition Bottleneck:** The measured delay in signal broadcasting caused by increased Effective Resistance ($R_{eff}$) in damaged axonal pathways (Axonal Shearing).



### **4. Case Study Analysis**

#### **Case Study #001: Mechanical Impulse Trigger**
* **Variable:** Intracranial Pressure Spikes.
* **Observation:** Seizure activity triggered immediately following high-intensity coughing fits.
* **RST Logic:** The cough creates a mechanical "spike" that disrupts the resonance stability. This demonstrates how physical impulses can override electrical anchors and collapse the Eigen-gap.



#### **Case Study #002: Longitudinal & Environmental Friction**
* **History:** 37-year longitudinal data (Age 13–50).
* **Environmental Noise:** Correlation between VOC (Paint fume) exposure and reduced signal stability.
* **System Artifacts:** Documentation of 6.1s lags and "Russian" speech aliasing during overstimulation.
* **Status:** Current system maintains stability at 3 events/year (reduced from 17) using environmental filtering.



### **5. Management Strategy (RST Framework)**
1. **Mechanical/Chemical Isolation:** Reducing external impulses and metabolic noise.
2. **Data-Load Filtering:** Managing social density to prevent processing overload.
3. **Phase-Locking:** Utilizing focal anchors to maintain the 39 Hz resonance.
