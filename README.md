​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1
​Spectral Engineering Model for Neural Topology & Signal Stability
​1. Executive Summary
​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1 provides a mathematical framework for modeling "Topological Friction" in neural networks following axonal shearing or traumatic injury. By utilizing Spectral Graph Theory, RST identifies the physical speed limits of consciousness, specifically the 6.1-second state-transition bottleneck and the 39 Hz Resonance Constant.
​2. Core Constants & Proofs
​Validated via the rst_stress_test.py engine, these constants define the boundaries of system stability:
​The 39 Hz Anchor: The target frequency for global phase-locking. When Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2) falls below 0.5000, the anchor becomes "Scattered."
​The 6.1s Event Horizon: The maximum temporal delay for signal integration. As connectivity approaches zero, signal latency reaches a hard limit of 6.100s, resulting in a system "reboot" (bifurcation/seizure).
​100ms "Now" Threshold: The baseline for real-time intentional processing.
​3. Case Study Analysis (V6.1 Validation)
​Case Study #001: Mechanical Impulse Trigger (Subject: Father)
​Variable: Intracranial Pressure Spikes (Coughing fits).
​RST Analysis: The cough acts as a mechanical "spike" that instantly severs the Eigen-gap.
​Result: Immediate transition from LOCKED (39Hz) to BIFURCATION (0Hz). This is a "Vertical Collapse" model.
​Case Study #002: Environmental Friction (Subject: Friend)
​History: 37-year longitudinal data (Age 13–50).
​Stressors: VOCs (Paint Department fumes).
​Observations: Documented 6.1s lag and "Russian" speech aliasing.
​RST Analysis: Chemical exposure acts as a "Horizontal Friction" multiplier, slowly pushing the system into the DRIFTING zone (2.4s - 4.6s delay) before the eventual collapse.

5. Installation & Usage
​The RST Engine is designed for lightweight deployment (Termux/Mobile compatible).
​Dependencies:
​Python 3.x
​NumPy
​Run a stress test:
python rst_stress_test.py
6. Governance & Ethics
​Non-Medical Status: RST is an analytical modeling tool, not a diagnostic medical device.
​Framework: This work is part of the Unified Chronicle of the Resonant Keeper, honoring the grief that started the journey and the math that mapped the way out.
