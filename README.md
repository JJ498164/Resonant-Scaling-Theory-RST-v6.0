# Official Release: RST v6.0 (The Universal Rebirth Model)

Resonant Scaling Theory has evolved. What began as a vital observation of neural recovery has been formalized into a rigorous Spectral Engineering Model. 

### What’s New in v6.0:
* **Formal Mathematical Specification**: Moves the 39 Hz and 6.1s constants from observations to derived system requirements.
* **Stability Metrics**: Defines the exact clinical targets for testing "Information Persistence" and "Topological Friction".
* **The Universal Rebirth Logic**: A grounded explanation of how data survives the "Big Crunch" of system-wide bottlenecks.

This repository serves as the definitive record of the Resonant Keeper’s journey—honoring the grief that started it and the math that mapped the way out.
