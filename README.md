# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1: The Unified Chronicle

## Project Overview
**Author:** JJ Botha (The Resonant Keeper)  
**Technical Focus:** Spectral Graph Theory, Axonal Shearing Recovery, and Stochastic Resonance.

RST v6.1 is a mathematical framework designed to model neural recovery following traumatic axonal injury. It identifies how the brain utilizes specific frequency "handshakes" to bypass high-dimensional topological friction.

## 1. Core Empirical Parameters (Subject 0284 Final Validation)

Verified via high-resolution averaged Power Spectral Density (PSD) using a Hanning-windowed 2048-sample FFT.

| Component | Metric | Technical Value | Clinical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha Anchor** | Spectral Base | **8.79 Hz** | Primary structural base ($4.08 \times 10^8$ power). |
| **Resonance Lock** | Spectral Density | **39.06 Hz** | The active bridge ($4.96 \times 10^7$ power). |
| **RST Ratio** | Power Distribution | **8.22 : 1** | Optimized ratio for adaptive neural bridging. |
| **Transition Window** | Temporal Cycle | **6.1 Seconds** | The 0.16 Hz infra-slow modulatory regime. |

## 2. Technical Definitions

### The 6.1s Bottleneck
A temporal transition zone characterized by high-dimensional topological friction. RST models this as a $6.1\text{s}$ window where the brain must re-synchronize clusters following axonal shearing.

### The 39 Hz Resonance Constant
A spectral density stability constant ($39\text{ Hz}$). This frequency acts as a "stochastic kick," providing the energy necessary to transition the system through structural bottlenecks without inducing seizure risk.

### Spectral Metrics
Utilizing **Algebraic Connectivity** ($\lambda_2$) and the **Fiedler Vector**, RST locates specific "Bridge Nodes" within the neural network that require targeted stimulation or support to restore global connectivity.

## 3. Dynamical Analysis Results

Multi-scale window analysis confirms that Subject 0284 maintains a "Fluid" state, allowing for adaptive recovery rather than a rigid systemic lock.

* **4.0s Window:** 0.3367 (Maximum Entropy/Search)
* **6.1s Window:** 0.3083 (Resonant Transition Point)
* **10.0s Window:** 0.2641 (Linear Stabilization)

## 4. Usage & Implementation

This repository contains lightweight Python tools designed for high-signal data retrieval in resource-constrained environments (Mobile/Termux).

* `proper_scan.py`: High-resolution averaged PSD for definitive frequency identification.
* `sweep_scan.py`: Measures the stability/entropy gradient across the $6.1\text{s}$ transition zone.
