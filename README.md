​🚀 The v6.0 Breakthrough: The Two-Timescale Model
​RST v6.0 formalizes the relationship between the brain's "software" (cognitive synchronization) and its "hardware" (metabolic supply). It identifies that the 6.1-second stall is not an error, but an exposed metabolic eigenmode that occurs when the 39 Hz fast-wave decouples from the structural bridge.
​The Grand Unified Equation
​The interaction between the high-frequency integration and the slow metabolic recovery is defined by the RST Characteristic Equation:
\left( s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_0 s + \omega_0^2 - G_0 e^{-s\tau} \right) \left( s + \frac{1}{6.1} \right) + \kappa e^{-s\tau} = 0
​\tau (12.8 ms): The physical conduction delay of the thalamocortical loop.
​f (39 Hz): The structural resonant frequency (f = \frac{1}{2\tau}).
​\kappa: The "Metabolic Tax" coupling constant.
