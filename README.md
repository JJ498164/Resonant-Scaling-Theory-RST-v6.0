​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v5.2: Spectral Engineering Framework
​Executive Summary
​RST v5.2 is a computational model for neural recovery following axonal shearing, moving beyond narrative "bottlenecks" into Spectral Engineering. It identifies how network topology dictates recovery speed and provides a mechanism for active stabilization via targeted frequency bursts.
​1. Core Mathematical Metrics
​The previous static 6.1s constant has been deprecated in favor of emergent spectral properties:
​Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2): The primary metric for network health. A "Blackout Zone" is defined where \lambda_2 < 0.18.
​Spectral Resilience Band (\tau): The distribution of relaxation times for sheared 100-node topologies clusters between 3.42 and 5.53 units.
​The 4.17 Anchor: The target relaxation time for a stabilized system.
​2. The Bio-Loop Recovery Protocol
​RST v5.2 introduces an active feedback mechanism to bypass topological friction:
​Adaptive Bridging: Real-time monitoring of \tau. If \tau > 4.17, the system initiates "Synthetic Edge" placement.
​Gamma Mapping: Each 39 Hz cycle is modeled as one Synthetic Edge added to the network.
​6-Cycle Stabilization: In high-shear environments, 6 cycles at 39 Hz (approx. 153ms) are required to shift \lambda_2 from 0.038 to the consensus threshold of 0.269.
​3. Definitions & Refinements
​Ghost-State: Technically defined as the persistence of the dominant slow eigenmode during network reconnection.
​Neural Intent: Modeled as the active generation of spectral power at 39 Hz to artificially increase \lambda_2 and lower global effective resistance (R_{eff}).
​Sheared Topology: Any network state where isolated functional clusters are connected by a high-resistance bottleneck (1-5 bridges).
​4. Speculative Interpretations (Quarantined)
​Refer to interpretation.md for subjective overlays.
​The Sentinel’s Creed and Universal Duty Cycles are maintained as philosophical extensions but are not yet supported by the primary mathematical derivations.
​5. Simulation & Verification
​Validation was performed via a 50-topology sweep on a 100-node graph using the continuous-time consensus protocol \dot{x} = -Lx. Results confirmed that while no universal 6.1s constant exists, the Spectral Resilience Band is a robust emergent property of sheared networks.
