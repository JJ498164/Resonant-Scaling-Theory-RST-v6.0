## 1. Scope & Classification
**IMPORTANT:** Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) is an **Analytical Framework and Mathematical Tool** used for modeling signal processing and topological friction in neural networks. 
* **NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE:** RST is not a diagnostic tool, a medical device, or a regulated treatment protocol. 
* **PURPOSE:** It serves as a theoretical lens to quantify "System Noise" and "Spectral Density." All health-related decisions must be made in consultation with qualified medical professionals.

## 2. Overview
RST v5.1 is a Spectral Engineering Model designed to quantify "Topological Friction" in neural networks following traumatic brain injury (TBI). While traditional neurology focuses on chemical imbalance, RST identifies the **Physical Speed Limit** of consciousness by mapping the Laplacian Eigen-gap between synchronized and incoherent states.

## 3. Core Technical Artifacts

### 3.1 The 6.1-Second Bottleneck
A topological artifact where signal traversal is delayed due to increased **Effective Resistance ($R_{eff}$)**. In cases of axonal shearing, the signal is forced through high-resistance bottlenecks, leading to "Ignition Delays" in Global Workspace broadcasting.



### 3.2 The 39 Hz Resonance Constant
The "Anchor Frequency" required for system stability. When environmental noise (VOCs/Chemicals) or social complexity (Crowded Rooms) increases, the system's **Algebraic Connectivity ($\lambda_2$)** collapses, leading to a catastrophic bifurcation (Seizure).

## 4. Longitudinal Case Studies (37-Year Dataset)
The repository documents the transition from high-frequency instability (17 events/year) to a "Spectral Plateau" (3 events/year), analyzing how environmental factors like VOC exposure (Paint Departments) act as metabolic "noise" that lowers the seizure threshold.
