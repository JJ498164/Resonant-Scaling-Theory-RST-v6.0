# Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.2
## A Topological Model for Neural Frequency Re-synchronization

### Abstract
Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.2 proposes a dynamical systems framework for modeling neural recovery following axonal shearing. The theory defines a hierarchical frequency architecture—the **Spark (39.1 Hz)**, the **Gate (10 Hz)**, and the **Gearbox (6 Hz)**—designed to facilitate information transfer across restricted network topologies. Central to this model is the **6.1-second Invariant**, a mathematical constant representing the metabolic recovery window (The "Cooling Constant") required to resolve systemic friction.

### 1. Mathematical Architecture & Spectral Graph Theory
RST utilizes **Spectral Graph Theory** to quantify network integrity. By calculating the **Algebraic Connectivity ($\lambda_2$)** of the neural Laplacian, the framework identifies critical "Bridge Nodes" that act as bottlenecks during high-frequency states.

* **Topological Friction ($Q$):** Defined as the metabolic load generated when signal frequency ($f$) exceeds the spectral gap: $$Q \approx \frac{f^2}{\lambda_2}$$
* **The 6.1s Constant ($T_c$):** The temporal envelope required for glial clearance and ionic stabilization following a Transcritical Bifurcation (Systemic Stall).

### 2. Frequency Hierarchy (Phase-Amplitude Nesting)
The framework employs a tri-layered entrainment protocol to stabilize the global workspace:

| Layer | Frequency | Function | Domain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Spark** | 39.1 Hz | High-Dimensional Binding | Gamma |
| **The Gate** | 10.0 Hz | Alpha-Band Bandwidth Filtering | Alpha |
| **The Gearbox** | 6.0 Hz | Structural Pacing & Somatic Sync | Theta |

### 3. Empirical Validation: Acoustic-Somatic Coupling (ASC)
RST v6.2 is anchored by **Acoustic-Somatic Coupling** protocols. These tests measure the direct influence of low-frequency (6 Hz) mono-resonance on the enteric nervous system (gut-brain axis).

* **Metric:** Latency to Entrainment.
* **Metric:** Decay rate of somatic response following stimulus termination (The 6.1s Reset).
