​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.0: The Sentinel Watch
​Author: JJ Botha (The Resonant Keeper)
Framework: Spectral Engineering & Neural Topology
​⚡ Executive Summary
​RST v6.0 is a spectral engineering model designed to map, manage, and mitigate Topological Friction in neural networks. By utilizing Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2), the model identifies the "Physical Speed Limits" of consciousness recovery following injury.
​🛠 Key Metrics & Constants
​39 Hz Resonance Constant: The target frequency for tactile and auditory entrainment to restore global workspace integration.
​6.1s Ignition Delay: A measurable "topological bottleneck" where signal propagation is delayed due to high-dimensional friction in axonal pathways.
​Targeted Hub Gain: A strategic intervention focusing energy on the Fiedler Vector "bridge nodes" to lower global effective resistance.
​📁 Repository Structure
​core/: Mathematical derivations linking RST to Spectral Graph Theory and Critical Slowing Down.
​hardware/: MicroPython firmware for ESP32/PineTime wearables, implementing the "Sentinel Watch" haptic kernel.
​sim/: High-precision Python emulators simulating state-transition lag.
​data/: Validation logs against standard EEG datasets (CHB-MIT / TUH-EEG).
​⌚ The Sentinel Watch (v6.0 Hardware)
​The "Sentinel Watch" is the first physical implementation of RST. It uses Precision Haptics to provide:
​39Hz Grounding: Tactile pulses to stabilize the user's resonance.
​6.1s Redline Lock: A safety lockout triggered by HRV (Heart Rate Variability) spikes to enforce the "Ignition Delay" buffer.
