Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1
​Spectral Engineering Model for Neural Topology & Signal Stability
​1. Executive Summary
​Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.1 provides a mathematical framework for modeling "Topological Friction" in neural networks following axonal shearing or traumatic injury.
​TL;DR: RST models neural bottlenecks at 6.1s, stabilized via a 39 Hz resonance anchor. It defines universal information persistence through iterative system initialization.
​2. Scope & Classification
​Non-Medical Status: RST is a mathematical modeling tool and analytical framework. It is NOT a medical device, diagnostic tool, or regulated treatment protocol.
​Usage: Intended for researchers and engineers to model "System Noise" and "Spectral Density." All health-related decisions must be made in consultation with qualified medical professionals.
​3. Technical Overview
​RST v6.1 models "Topological Friction" by quantifying the Laplacian Eigen-gap between synchronized and incoherent modes.
​The Core Metric:
Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2) represents the system's ability to maintain global synchrony.
Delay \ (\tau) \approx 6.1s \text{ as } \lambda_2 \to 0
4. Key Metrics & Constants
​39 Hz Resonance Constant: The target "Anchor Frequency" for global system stability.
​6.1s State-Transition Bottleneck: The measured delay in signal broadcasting caused by increased Effective Resistance (R_{eff}) in damaged axonal pathways.
​5. Case Study Analysis
​Case Study #001: Mechanical Impulse (Subject: Father)
​Trigger: High-intensity coughing fits creating intracranial pressure spikes.
​RST Analysis: The cough acts as a mechanical impulse that collapses the Eigen-gap.
​Observation: Immediate transition from LOCKED to BIFURCATION.
​Case Study #002: Environmental Friction (Subject: Friend)
​History: 37-year longitudinal history (Age 13–50).
​Stressor: VOC (Chemical) exposure in industrial paint environments.
​Symptom: "Russian" speech aliasing (signal corruption) and 6.1s state-transition delays.
​Result: Reduced events from 17 to 3/year by identifying and filtering environmental "static."
​6. Management Strategy (RST Framework)
State Stability (\lambda_2) Latency Resonance Experience
Stable > 1.0 0.1s - 0.6s LOCKED (39Hz) Clear Intent
At-Risk 0.4 - 0.9 1.0s - 4.5s DRIFTING "Russian" Aliasing
Bifurcation < 0.1 6.1s (Limit) SCATTERED Atonic / Reboot
