RST v5.1: Technical Rebuttal & Scaling Defense

1.  Scope: Targeted Injury vs. General Connectomics
    Standard critiques regarding Kleiber’s Law (3/4 power scaling) apply to steady-state basal metabolic rates. RST v5.1 specifically models Dynamic Topological Friction in a high-resistance regime (Axonal Shearing).

2.  Defense of the Quadratic Law (1/lambda_2^2)
    While healthy brain networks exhibit high efficiency, a "broken bridge" transitions into a Quadratic Drag Regime. The energy cost to drive a signal across a high-resistance topological bottleneck scales with the square of the resistance (Reff), which is inversely proportional to the spectral gap (lambda_2).

3.  SNR Collapse (SNR approx lambda_2^3)
    In sparse graphs, mixing time and signal reliability collapse far more aggressively than in dense, healthy networks. The cubic scaling reflects the phase transition of a network reaching structural failure, where alternative signal paths drop exponentially.

4.  The 6.1s Empirical Fixed Point
    The 6.1s "Ignition Delay" serves as the Empirical Calibration Point for the model. It represents the temporal threshold where the 1/lambda_2^2 friction meets the metabolic ceiling of the cortical column.

5.  Conclusion
    RST v5.1 is a Pathological Implementation Model. Validation should be measured via the Phase-Lag Index and Gamma-Band Coherence during 6.1s stall events.
