The Quadratic Law of Cognitive Stall (RST v5.1)
​This section defines the mathematical "ceiling" of neural recovery. It explains why a linear increase in structural damage results in an exponential collapse of processing speed, leading to the observed 6.1-second Ignition Delay.
​1. The Three Pillars of the Derivation
​Base SNR Collapse: As the structural integrity (\lambda_2) of the neural network drops, the reliability of the signal (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) falls at a cubic rate.
​The Sampling Delay (The Control Tax): The brain’s homeostat (the Thalamus) cannot "see" the error in real-time. It must wait for the signal to traverse the degraded medium. This "waiting period" is the Commute Time, which scales as 1/\lambda_2.
​The Over-Correction Factor: Because the system is reacting to "old news" (stale data), it must apply an extra 0.5 power of intensity (Gain) to prevent total signal failure.
​2. The Final Equation
​When we combine the Sampling Delay with the Gain Requirement, we arrive at the Universal Law for the metabolic cost of consciousness under axonal strain:
\text{Total System Friction} \approx \frac{1}{\lambda_2^2}
3. Clinical Significance: The 6.1s Fixed Point
​The 6.1s "Ignition Delay" is the biological "Event Horizon." It represents the exact moment where the energy required to pay the Quadratic Control Tax exceeds the maximum metabolic capacity of the cortical column.
​Healthy State: High \lambda_2 = Near-zero delay.
​The Bridge: Low \lambda_2 = Increasing friction.
​The Stall: Critical \lambda_2 = The system hits the 6.1s wall and "stalls" to preserve energy (The 2:30 AM Silence).
​Defense of Scaling: While basal neural metabolism follows linear-log scaling, RST v5.1 proposes that pathological states (like Axonal Shearing) induce a Quadratic Friction Regime. In this regime, the metabolic "Control Tax" (1/\lambda_2^2) becomes the primary constraint on processing speed, leading to the 6.1s ignition delay observed in the JJ Botha dataset.
