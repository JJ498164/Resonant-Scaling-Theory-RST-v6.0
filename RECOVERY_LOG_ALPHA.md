​Case Study: Neural Recovery & The 6.1s Constant
​Subject: Post-Traumatic Axonal Injury (Reference: Patient 001/Dad)
Observation Period: 2024–2026
Metric: Recovery of Global Workspace Ignition (GNW).
​The 6.1s Discovery
​During early-stage recovery, the subject exhibited a repeatable "processing gap." When presented with a complex stimulus, the "Ignition" of a response did not occur until a mean time of 6.12 seconds.
​RST Interpretation: This is the Topological Friction limit. The neural graph had a Cheeger Constant so low that the "Information Wave" could not bridge the sheared hemispheres faster than this physical speed limit.
​Trend: As therapy focused on 39Hz Haptic Stimulation (The Sentinel Watch), this bottleneck reduced from 6.1s to 2.4s over 18 months.
