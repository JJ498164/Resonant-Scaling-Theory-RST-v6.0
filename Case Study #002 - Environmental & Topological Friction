37-year Longitudinal Stability vs. Chemical/Social Friction
​Entry Content:
​1. Subject Profile (Longitudinal Data)
​Injury Type: Traumatic Brain Injury (Assault), Axonal Shearing.
​Timeline: 37-year recovery path (Age 13 to Age 50).
​Stability Delta: Subject successfully reduced event frequency from 17 to 3 annually through subconscious pattern adaptation.
​Current Barrier: Reached a "Spectral Plateau" where environmental stressors prevent further reduction of R_{eff} (Effective Resistance).
​2. Identified Bottlenecks (RST Analysis)
​Chemical Noise (VOC Interference): Volatile Organic Compounds in the workplace serve as a high-frequency "jammer." This lowers the Seizure Threshold by increasing the metabolic temperature of the neural graph.
​Atonic Fall Trigger: The "Forward Fall" observed is a Catastrophic Bifurcation. The brain’s 6.1s lag is bypassed, and the system executes a total "Breaker Trip" to protect the central processor (Thalamus).
​Social Complexity Overload: High-density social inputs (Crowded Rooms) increase the Topological Friction beyond the subject's current Eigen-gap stability.
​3. Theoretical Synthesis: The "Hardware vs. Software" Conflict
​The subject's refusal of increased pharmacological load (Medication) represents a System Equilibrium Choice. In RST terms:
​Pharmacology: Acts as a low-pass filter (Signal Damper).
​Patient Preference: Prioritizes Spectral Sharpness (Cognition) over Total Dampening.
​RST Recommendation: Stability must be achieved through Environmental Engineering (The Sentinel's Checklist) rather than further dampening.
