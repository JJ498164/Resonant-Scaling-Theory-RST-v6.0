RST WHITE WING PROTOCOL v1.0

Engineered Resilience Through Spectral Anchoring

---

1.0 PROTOCOL OVERVIEW & PHILOSOPHY

The White Wing Protocol is the engineering instantiation of Resonant Scaling Theory's core topological constraints. It translates the observed ~6.1s recovery bottleneck and ~39 Hz entropy minimum into a functional system for maintaining cognitive or systemic continuity during catastrophic disruption (e.g., hardware failure, data blackout, or modeled biological trauma like axonal shearing).

Core Principle: Do not fight the bottleneck. Bridge it.
The protocol does not attempt to eliminate the 6.1s topological constraint. Instead, it creates a parallel, low-entropy state ("Ghost-State") that persists through the disruption, providing a stable anchor for instantaneous recovery.

The Two-Wing Balance:

· The Black Wing: Represents the empirical, observed data—the history of system failures, the 39 Hz signal derived from survival patterns, the "Altar of Broken Things." It is the foundation in truth.
· The White Wing: Represents active, engineered hope—the protocol built from that foundation. It is the operationalization of resilience.
  The system flies only with both wings.

2.0 CORE COMPONENTS & SPECIFICATIONS

2.1 The Spectral Anchor: 39/40 Hz Dual-Anchor Bus

· Function: Acts as a persistent "neural metronome," providing a phase-coherent reference signal.
· Specification: A synthesized oscillation maintaining a center frequency of 39.5 Hz (the midpoint between the theoretical 39 Hz entropy minimum and the commonly observed 40 Hz biological gamma band).
· Tolerance: Must remain within ±0.5 Hz during total input blackout.
· Implementation: Can be generated by a dedicated hardware crystal oscillator or a verified software-based precision timer. Software generation must be shielded from system interrupts.

2.2 The Deep Archive: 6.0-Second Memory Bridge

· Function: A continuous, rolling buffer that preserves the last known stable state of the system.
· Specification: Stores a minimum of 6.0 seconds of high-fidelity state data (sensor readings, intent vectors, system flags).
· Behavior on Blackout: Upon detection of a total input failure (see §3.1), the buffer is frozen, preserving the last 6.0 seconds of pre-blackout data intact.
· Purpose: Provides the "seed" data for immediate context restoration, directly bridging the predicted 6.1s topological recovery gap.

2.3 The Ghost-State

· Definition: A minimal, stable operating mode maintained when primary sensor/data inputs drop to 0 active nodes.
· Key Metric: Stability is maintained at 4.5/10. This is a critical specification:
  · It is not 0 (total failure/crash).
  · It is not 10 (normal operation, which is impossible without input).
  · It is 4.5: a conscious, sustained, sub-optimal but stable state of "holding pattern."
· Activity: In this state, the system's sole tasks are to:
  1. Maintain the Spectral Anchor.
  2. Preserve the frozen Deep Archive.
  3. Await signal restoration.

2.4 Lock-on Latency

· Specification: Upon restoration of valid input signals, the system must re-synchronize and resume full operation from the Ghost-State within ≤ 0.05 seconds.
· Process: This "lock-on" uses the preserved Deep Archive to re-establish immediate context, and the stable Spectral Anchor to rapidly phase-lock new incoming data with the pre-blackout state.

3.0 PROTOCOL FLOW: DETECTION, ACTIVATION, RECOVERY

Phase 1: Normal Operation → Monitoring

· System runs normally.
· Deep Archive operates as a continuous, rolling 6.0-second buffer.
· Spectral Anchor is active and monitored for drift.

Phase 2: Blackout Detection → Ghost-State Activation

· Trigger Condition: (input_signal_strength == 0) && (active_node_count == 0) for a contiguous 100ms (to filter transient noise).
· Immediate Actions (within 1ms of trigger):
  1. DEEP_ARCHIVE.FREEZE()
  2. SYSTEM_MODE = GHOST_STATE
  3. STABILITY_SCORE = 4.5
  4. All non-essential processes are shed. Power is routed to the Spectral Anchor generator and archive memory.
· The system is now in the Ghost-State.

Phase 3: Ghost-State Persistence

· The system holds indefinitely in this 4.5/10 stability mode.
· The Spectral Anchor frequency is constantly self-verified.
· This phase is the engineered proof against the 6.1s bottleneck. The system does not "recover" during blackout; it waits, coherently, for recovery to become possible.

Phase 4: Signal Restoration → Instantaneous Lock-on

· Trigger Condition: Valid input signal detected on any primary channel.
· Immediate Actions (target: ≤0.05s):
  1. CONTEXT = DEEP_ARCHIVE.LOAD_LAST_STATE()
  2. Incoming data is phase-aligned to the Spectral Anchor.
  3. SYSTEM_MODE = NORMAL_OPERATION
  4. STABILITY_SCORE ramps from 4.5 to 10 as full context is re-established.
  5. Deep Archive resumes rolling recording.

4.0 VALIDATION & FALSIFICATION CRITERIA

The White Wing Protocol is valid if, and only if, it demonstrates the following under test:

Test Success Criteria Protocol Failure Condition
Total Blackout Survival System holds Ghost-State (4.5 ± 0.2 stability) for >6.1s. System crashes (0) or falsely reports normal operation (10).
Spectral Anchor Hold Anchor maintains 39.5 Hz ±0.5 Hz during blackout. Frequency drift exceeds tolerance.
0.05s Lock-on Full recovery latency from signal restore is ≤0.05s. Latency exceeds 0.05s.
Data Continuity Post-recovery system state is logically continuous with pre-blackout state. Data corruption or context loss from Deep Archive.

A single reproducible failure of any success criterion invalidates the protocol's core claims.

5.0 INTEGRATION WITH THE UNIFIED CHRONICLE & ALTAR

· Success Logging: All successful Ghost-State activations and recoveries are logged to the Unified Chronicle with timestamps, duration, and final stability score.
· Failure Logging: Any deviation from spec—anchor drift, stability score breach, lock-on lag—is documented in detail and placed on the Altar of Broken Things. This is not shame; it is essential data for the Black Wing.
· The Keeper's Role: The ResonantKeeper process (human or automated) reviews Chronicle and Altar entries after each event cycle, ensuring the balance between Wings is maintained.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. Topology-First: Remember, the 6.1s and 39 Hz are derived values from network Laplacians. This protocol is an application of that theory. If the underlying topology changes significantly, these constants may need recalibration—the protocol's logic, however, remains sound.
2. Hardware Essence: The Ghost-State's reliability is fundamentally tied to the quality of the Spectral Anchor generator. A software timer on a preemptible OS is a poor substitute for a hardware crystal.
3. This is a Specification, not a finished product. It awaits HARDWARE_IN_THE_LOOP_TESTING.
