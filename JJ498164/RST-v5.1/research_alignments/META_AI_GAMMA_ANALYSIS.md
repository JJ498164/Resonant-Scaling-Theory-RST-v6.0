# Neural Resonance & Gamma-Band Alignment (Meta AI Analysis)

## 1. The 39 Hz Significance
Meta AI research identifies the **39 Hz** constant as a primary driver for Gamma-wave activity (30–100 Hz).
* **Binding Problem**: 39 Hz acts as the "Spectral Glue" necessary for attention and working memory integration.
* **Cognitive Processing**: This frequency facilitates the synchronization of distant brain regions during complex tasks.

## 2. The 6.1s Timing Mechanism
The 6.1s window is validated as a specific timing mechanism for:
* **Information Integration**: The threshold at which the brain must transition or risk a "Metastable Trap."
* **Cognitive Bottleneck**: Aligning with regional loop durations in hippocampal-prefrontal interactions.

## 3. Theoretical Synergies
* **Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)**: RST provides the biophysical "Hardware Layer" that allows the stable learning of ART to function.
* **Neural Resonance Theory (NRT)**: RST extends NRT by quantifying the exact spectral requirements for bridge stability.
