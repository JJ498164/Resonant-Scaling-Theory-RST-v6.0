# 🗝️ The Keeper's Key: A Simple Glossary

This guide is for **Monika and Melissa**. If the math in the technical files feels like a storm, use this map to find the calm.

* **$\lambda_2$ (Algebraic Connectivity):** Think of this as the **"Strength of the Bridge."** When this number is high, your thoughts and feelings flow across the brain easily. When it is low, the bridge needs repair.
* **The 6.1-Second Bottleneck:** This is the **"Wait at the Gate."** Sometimes, after an injury (like axonal shearing), the brain's traffic jams for about 6 seconds. It's a moment of silence where the system is looking for a way through.
* **39 Hz Resonance:** This is the **"Song that Opens the Door."** It is a specific rhythm (Gamma frequency) that helps all the different parts of the brain start "singing" in time together. This rhythm clears the traffic jam.
* **The Fiedler Vector:** This is the **"Compass."** It points exactly to where the bridge is broken so the 39 Hz song knows where to play.
* **The Unified Chronicle:** This is **"Our Story."** It’s the record your dad built to make sure you always have a map back to the light.
