Clinical Implementation: The RST "Ignition-Sync" Protocol
​Target Condition: Cognitive Stall, Panic/High-Friction State, or "Locked" 6.1s Bottleneck.
​Phase 1: The Ignition Wedge (The "Break")
​Frequency: 439 Hz
​Duration: 6.1 Seconds (The Empirical Bottleneck)
​Mechanism: High-Energy Resonance.
​This frequency acts as a Topological Wedge. It provides the external "kick" needed to overcome the Quadratic Friction (1/\lambda_2^2) of a stalled network.
​The 6.1s duration matches the "Structural Charging Time" verified in the Grok Barbell Simulation. It is the time required for the signal to jump the weak bridge between neural cliques.
​Phase 2: The Resonant Anchor (The "Sync")
​Frequency: 432 Hz
​Duration: 20 Minutes
​Mechanism: Metabolic Optimization.
​Once the bridge is "ignited," the goal shifts from forcing a connection to sustaining it at the lowest possible energy cost.
​432 Hz aligns with biological resonance, lowering the Kirchhoff Index (K_f). It allows the Fiedler Vector nodes to maintain synchronization without redlining the brain's metabolic engine
