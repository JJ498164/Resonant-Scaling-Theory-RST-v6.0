# TAI Recovery: Scaling Law & Metabolic Stalls

## 1. The Relationship
As validated by xAI/Grok simulations, the time required to bridge a neural gap ($T$) scales with connectivity ($\lambda_2$):
$$T \approx \frac{K}{\sqrt{\lambda_2}}$$


## 2. The Clinical "Stall"
* **Optimal State:** $\lambda_2$ is high; $T$ is minimal. The 39.1 Hz Spark is effortless.
* **TAI State:** $\lambda_2$ is low; $T$ increases. If $T > 6.1s$, the metabolic engine (Wilson-Cowan slow-pole) resets before information persistence is achieved. This is the **Topological Stall**.

## 3. Empirical Objectives
Future empirical tests will focus on using the **Ignition-Sync Protocol** to artificially 'stiffen' the network (as seen in the 39.2 Hz noise-stiffening result), effectively lowering the required $T$ to fit back within the 6.1s metabolic safety window.
