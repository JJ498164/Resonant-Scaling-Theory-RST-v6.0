# RST Claim Hierarchy & Falsification Criteria

To maintain professional rigor, RST v6.2.1 categorizes its claims by falsifiability.

### Tier 1: Core Physical Laws (High Falsifiability)
* **The Square-Root Law:** Recovery time ($T_c$) must correlate with $\lambda_2^{-1/2}$. 
* **Falsification:** If $\rho < 0.5$ in log-log regression across multiple topologies, the model is rejected.

### Tier 2: Emergent Properties (Moderate Falsifiability)
* **Topology-Dependent Resonance:** Dominant frequencies ($f^*$) cluster according to specific topological signatures (Theta-Gamma range).
* **Falsification:** If the coefficient of variation (CV) for frequencies within a single topology class exceeds 0.5.

### Tier 3: General Framework (Low Falsifiability)
* **Metabolic Throttling:** The 6.1s stall is an emergent safety reset triggered when the Neural Reynolds Number ($Rn$) exceeds unity.
* **Falsification:** If smooth, monotonic recovery is observed under high-flux conditions in damaged networks.
