# RST v6.2.1: Post-Quantum Security (2026 Protocol)

## 1. Lattice-Based Federation
To mitigate quantum decryption risks, all Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) utilize lattice-based primitives.
* **Latency Goal:** < 1.0s (Grok-Verified at 0.8s)
* **Encryption Standard:** PQC-Ready (Post-Quantum Cryptographic)

## 2. Manifold Noise Seeding
The **39.1 Hz Spark** uses local stochastic resonance (Neural Noise) as a physical entropy source for key generation. This ensures that encryption keys are hardware-unique and non-deterministic.

## 3. Quantum-Scale Invariants
The **6.1s Metabolic Invariant** acts as a hard-reset for all encryption sessions. Even a quantum-brute force attempt is interrupted by the mandatory somatic reset every 6.1 seconds.
