# Specification: The Neural Reynolds Number ($Rn$)

$Rn$ is a dimensionless ratio used to predict transitions from stable (Laminar) information flux to chaotic (Turbulent) metabolic stalls.

$$Rn = \frac{\Phi \cdot L}{\lambda_2 \cdot \nu}$$

### Parameter Definitions:
* **$\Phi$ (Information Flux):** Measured in bits/sec.
* **$L$:** Characteristic path length of the neural bridge.
* **$\lambda_2$:** The Spectral Gap (Algebraic Connectivity).
* **$\nu$:** Synaptic viscosity (metabolic clearance rate).

### Phase Transitions:
* **$Rn < 1$:** Laminar Flow. Stable signal propagation.
* **$Rn \approx 1$:** Criticality. Maximum efficiency at the 39.1 Hz / 6 Hz resonance.
* **$Rn > 1$:** Turbulence. Topological reset (6.1s stall) is triggered to prevent metabolic exhaustion.
