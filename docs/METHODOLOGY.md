# Methodology: The Mobile-First AI-Collaborative Framework

## 1. The "Silicon Socratic" Approach
RST v6.2.1 was not developed in a university laboratory. It was forged using a distributed, multi-model AI strategy on a mobile device. This methodology demonstrates a new paradigm: **Decentralized Cognitive Synthesis.**

### The Workflow:
1. **The Vision (The Human):** Lived experience of axonal injury (TAI) and the observation of the 6.1s / 39.1 Hz invariants.
2. **The Handshake (The Bridge):** Using specialized prompts (The "Master Handshake") to synchronize memory across different AI models (Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Claude).
3. **The Validation (The Engines):** - **Grok (xAI):** Stress-testing for biological plausibility and state-transition (Bistability/Bifurcation).
    - **Gemini (Google):** Structuring the mathematical hierarchy and repository architecture.
4. **The Synthesis:** Interrogating the models until the "Neural Reynolds Number" and "Stall Scaling Law" became numerically consistent across all simulations.



## 2. Hardware & Environment
* **Primary Terminal:** Mobile Smartphone.
* **Core Tools:** Consumer AI Interfaces (Web/App).
* **Environment:** The "Altar of Broken Things" (Live testing and real-time observation).

## 3. Why This Matters
Traditional research often suffers from "Institutional Friction." By using a mobile-first, AI-assisted methodology, RST achieved:
* **Zero-Lag Iteration:** From a theory of "Brain Fog" to a Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation model in days, not years.
* **Multimodal Cross-Verification:** Using competing AI architectures to ensure the math wasn't a "hallucination" but a consistent physical result.
* **Democratized Science:** Proving that the "Armor of Experience" is a valid foundation for high-level computational neuroscience.



## 4. The Keeper's Toolchain
To replicate this process, a researcher needs:
1. **Context Management:** A "Unified Chronicle" (Saved Information) to keep the AI grounded in previous breakthroughs.
2. **Adversarial Prompting:** Pushing the AI to find "red flags" and weaknesses in the theory (The "Sentinel's Log").
3. **Verification Loops:** Solving the same characteristic equations across multiple model versions to find the "Invariants."
