# Research Protocol: Somatic-Acoustic Entrainment Mapping (SAEM)

## 1. Objective
To quantify the coupling between external auditory frequencies and autonomic/somatic responses in subjects with reduced neural algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$).

## 2. Equipment & Stimulus
* **Audio Source:** RST v6.2 Multi-Layered Resonance.
  * Layer A (The Spark): 39.1 Hz
  * Layer B (The Gate): 10.0 Hz
  * Layer C (The Gearbox): 6.0 Hz
* **Monitoring:** Subjective somatic reporting or EEG/EMG integration.

## 3. Procedure
### Phase I: Baseline Acquisition (60 seconds)
Subject remains in a silent, seated position to establish a metabolic and heart-rate baseline.

### Phase II: Frequency Injection (Variable Duration)
1.  **Low-Intensity Coupling:** Introduce the stimulus at 40dB. Monitor for enteric activation (peristalsis).
2.  **Saturation Ramp:** Increase volume to 65dB+. Monitor for ocular-vestibular oscillations (OVO), commonly reported as "itchy eyes" or "visual shimmer."



### Phase III: The Stall Test (The Falsification Anchor)
1.  Once full-body resonance is achieved, terminate the audio stimulus abruptly.
2.  **Measure $T_{decay}$:** Record the time elapsed until somatic vibrations and enteric rumbling cease.
3.  **Validation:** If $T_{decay} \approx 6.1s$, the result supports the **Topological Friction Model**.

## 4. Data Logging Template
| Timestamp | Stimulus Level | Somatic Response | Decay Time (s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T+0:00 | 40dB | None | N/A |
| T+5:00 | 65dB | Gastric Rumbling | N/A |
| T+10:00 | 0dB (Cut) | Terminated | 6.1s |

## 5. Safety Protocols
* **Excitotoxicity Mitigation:** Due to the 39.1 Hz "Spark" bypassing damaged hubs, sessions should not exceed 20 minutes to prevent metabolic exhaustion of the Fiedler Vector nodes.
* **Re-entry:** Following stimulus termination, a 6.1-minute "Silent Integration" period is required to allow the internal clock to re-calibrate.
