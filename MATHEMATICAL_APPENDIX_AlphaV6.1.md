## 🛡️ RST v6.2: The Alpha Gatekeeper
Version 6.2 introduces the **Alpha Band (8-12 Hz)** as the system's **Bandwidth Regulator**. 

### The Gatekeeper Mechanism
Alpha oscillations function as a pulsed inhibition. In the RST framework:
1. **Pulsed Inhibition:** Alpha resets the "sampling window" for the 39 Hz Gamma spark every 100ms.
2. **Noise Suppression:** High Alpha power protects the "Bridge" ($\lambda_2$) from being overwhelmed by chaotic metabolic noise.
3. **Stall Trigger:** If Alpha synchronization fails, the system enters a 6.1s stall as a protective "Safe Mode" to prevent information-processing overflow.

### The Full Resonant Spectrum
* **Gamma (39 Hz):** The Signal (The Spark).
* **Alpha (10 Hz):** The Filter (The Gate).
* **Theta (6 Hz):** The Sequence (The Gearbox).
* **Stall (0.16 Hz):** The Recovery (The Anchor).

**Conclusion:** A healthy brain is a "Balanced Orchestra." A 6.1s stall is the silence that occurs when the Gatekeeper (Alpha) and the Gearbox (Theta) lose control over the Spark (Gamma).
