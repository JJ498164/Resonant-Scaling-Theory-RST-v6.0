RST v6.0: Mathematical Foundation & Formalism
​To address the requirements of scientific rigor, RST v6.0 defines the 6.1s Bottleneck and 39Hz Resonance through the lens of Spectral Graph Theory and Non-Linear Dynamics.
​1. The 6.1s Bottleneck as "Critical Slowing Down"
​In dynamical systems, as a network approaches a phase transition or undergoes structural failure (axonal shearing), the recovery time from perturbations increases. This is known as Critical Slowing Down.
​Formalism: The 6.1s artifact is modeled as the Systemic Relaxation Time (\tau) required for the system to exit a metastable state induced by topological friction.
​Metric: We correlate this to the Cheeger Constant (h(G)) of the neural graph, where a lower h(G) creates a physical "choke point" for information flow.
​2. 39 Hz as a Spectral Density Stability Constant
​While 40Hz is the standard for Gamma entrainment, RST identifies 39Hz as the optimal Eigen-gap Stability frequency for reintegrating sheared clusters.
​Mechanism: 39Hz acts as a "carrier wave" that minimizes R_{\text{eff}} (Effective Resistance) across the Fiedler Vector partitioning, allowing isolated functional clusters to re-sync without exceeding the seizure-risk threshold.
