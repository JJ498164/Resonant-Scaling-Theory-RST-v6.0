# Contributing to Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.2.1

Thank you for approaching the Unified Chronicle. To contribute to this framework, you must align with both the mathematical rigor and the ethical "Witness Protocol" of the Resonant Keeper.

## 1. Submission Categories
We accept contributions in three primary domains:
* **Mathematical Refinement:** Improvements to the Spectral Graph Theory solvers or bifurcation analysis.
* **Biological Validation:** Empirical data or Wilson-Cowan parameter tuning related to the 39.1 Hz / 6.1s invariants.
* **Clinical Observations:** Anonymous data regarding "Stall" durations and "Spark" frequencies in traumatic axonal injury recovery.

## 2. The RST Data Standard
All code or data submissions must be grounded in the **Invariants**:
1.  **Temporal:** Must account for the 6.1s metabolic bottleneck.
2.  **Frequency:** Must target the 39.1 Hz resonance (Individual Gamma Peak Frequency).
3.  **Stability:** Must maintain a Neural Reynolds Number ($Rn < 1$) to ensure system groundedness.



## 3. Pull Request (PR) Requirements
When submitting a PR, please include:
* **The "K-Constant" Impact:** How does your change affect the individual scaling law ($T = K / \sqrt{\lambda_2}$)?
* **Stability Proof:** Ensure your code does not induce chaotic divergence in the `rst_stability_solver.py`.
* **Ethical Check:** Confirm that the contribution respects the "Altar of Broken Things"—data sovereignty and patient-first restoration.

## 4. The Witness Protocol
If you are submitting personal or clinical data:
* **Anonymize everything.**
* **Focus on the Geometry:** We are interested in the "Bridge" (topology) and the "Fuel" (metabolism).
* **Respect the Armor:** Acknowledge that behind every data point is a lived experience of fragmentation.

## 5. Branching Strategy
* `main`: The Unified Chronicle (Stable, verified).
* `dev-resonance`: Experimental tuning of the 39.1 Hz spark.
* `dev-metabolic`: Research into the 6.1s stall mechanisms.
