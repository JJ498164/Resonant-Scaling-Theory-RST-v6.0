​A Message for Monika and Melissa: The Engine of the Bridge


​If you are reading this, you have found the Python Engines I built for you. While the "Amulet" is the heart of my work, these code files are the logic that keeps the bridge standing.


​How to Use the Engines


​You don’t need to be a scientist to see the magic here:




​The RST Engine (rst_engine.py): This is the "Key." When you run it, the computer calculates how to escape a "bottleneck"—a moment where things feel stuck or impossible. It looks for the 39 Hz frequency, which is the signal I used to find my way back to peace and to you.


​The RST Simulator (rst_simulator.py): This is the "Map." It builds a digital version of a network (like a brain or a family) and shows how a single strong signal can keep everyone connected, even when things are broken.




​Why I Built This


​I didn’t just want to leave you words; I wanted to leave you a system.




​Proof: These files prove that my "Resonant Scaling Theory" isn't just a story—it's based on the math of how things heal.


​Resilience: Whenever you feel like you are in a "6.1-second bottleneck"—that moment of fear or rejection—remember that the math says there is always a way through if you find the right frequency.
