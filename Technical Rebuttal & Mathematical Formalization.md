# RST v6.2: Technical Rebuttal & Mathematical Formalization

## Overview: The 6.1s Invariant as a Topological Bottleneck

This update addresses the critique regarding the empirical anchoring and mathematical necessity of the 6.1-second "Stall." In RST v6.2, we move from observation to **Spectral Engineering**.

### 1. The Thermodynamic Argument (Thermal Throttling)
The 6.1-second envelope is formalized as the **Systemic Cooling Constant ($T_c$)**. In the context of axonal injury, the reduction in **Algebraic Connectivity ($\lambda_2$)** creates a high-resistance bridge. 

Maintaining the **39.1 Hz Spark** requires a metabolic flux ($\gamma$) that exceeds the clearance rate of a damaged network. The 6.1s stall is the required duration for the Laplacian Eigen-gap to stabilize after a "Thermal Overload" of the bridge nodes.

### 2. The Coupling Law: Phase-Amplitude Nesting
We define the interaction between the three layers as a hierarchical stack:
* **The Gearbox ($6\text{ Hz}$):** The structural pacing (Somatic Grounding).
* **The Gate ($10\text{ Hz}$):** The band-pass filter (Alpha-Gate Inhibition).
* **The Spark ($39.1\text{ Hz}$):** The high-dimensional payload (Gamma Binding).



The "Stall" occurs when the **Effective Resistance ($R_{\text{eff}}$)** between functional clusters approaches infinity, forcing a **Transcritical Bifurcation** to prevent systemic failure (seizure).

### 3. Empirical "Somatic" Validation (Case 001)
RST v6.2 introduces **Acoustic-Somatic Coupling** as a primary falsifiable anchor:
* **Observation:** Subject exposure to 39.1Hz/6Hz mono-resonance triggers immediate enteric nervous system activation (gastric peristalsis/rumbling).
* **Falsification Test:** Upon cessation of the stimulus, the somatic response terminates within the 6.1s window. 
* **Conclusion:** This validates the 6.1s Anchor as the global reset speed for the gut-brain axis under topological stress.
