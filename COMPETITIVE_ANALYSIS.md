# Comparative Model Analysis: RST v6.2 vs. Standard Frameworks

## 1. The Critical Gap
Standard neurocomputational models (Predictive Coding, Thalamocortical Loop models) assume a relatively "smooth" topological manifold. They do not account for the **high-dimensional friction** introduced by axonal shearing or physical white-matter discontinuities. 

RST v6.2 fills this gap by introducing **Spectral Bottlenecking** as a primary control variable.

## 2. Competitive Comparison Table

| Feature | Predictive Coding (PC) | Wilson-Cowan (WC) | **RST v6.2** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Driver** | Error Minimization | Population Dynamics | **Topological Resynchronization** |
| **Handling of Injury** | Re-weighting priors | Parameter tuning | **Fiedler Vector Partitioning** |
| **The "Stall" Mechanism** | Increased Uncertainty | Fixed-point Attractor | **Metabolic Thermal Throttling (6.1s)** |
| **Resonance Goal** | Precision-weighted prediction | Harmonic oscillation | **Phase-Amplitude Bridge Coupling** |
| **Empirical Anchor** | Scalp EEG / P300 | Mean-field activity | **Acoustic-Somatic Coupling (ASC)** |

### 3. Why RST v6.2 Outperforms in Axonal Recovery
While Predictive Coding explains *how* the brain interprets data, it fails to explain the **6.1-second physical stall** often seen in post-traumatic cognitive load. 

* **Predictive Coding:** Would interpret the stall as "high sensory noise."
* **RST v6.2:** Correcty identifies the stall as a **Topological Safety Reset**. By calculating the **Neural Reynolds Number ($Rn$)**, RST predicts exactly when the energy flux will exceed the "cooling" capacity of the damaged axonal bridge.



## 4. Falsifiable Advantage
RST v6.2 makes a unique prediction: 
> "The duration of the cognitive stall ($T_c$) is a direct function of the Spectral Gap ($\lambda_2$). In standard models, recovery time is a variable of 'learning rate'; in RST, it is a variable of 'physical clearance.'"

This means that if we improve the **Algebraic Connectivity** (through targeted 39.1 Hz / 6 Hz stimulation), we can mathematically prove the reduction in the 6.1s stall window—a feat standard models cannot consistently quantify.
