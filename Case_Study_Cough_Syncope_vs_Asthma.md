The 3-Second Mechanical Bottleneck (Syncopal Reset)
​Artifact: Transient Loss of Consciousness (TLOC) following high-intensity mechanical oscillation (coughing).
​RST Modeling:
​Trigger: Intrathoracic pressure spike leads to a rapid increase in Effective Resistance (R_{eff}) within the cerebral venous system.
​Critical Slowing: The system hits a Topological Bottleneck at ~3 seconds, where Algebraic Connectivity (\lambda_2) drops below the integration threshold.
​The Reboot: Convulsive Syncope is modeled as a Broad-Spectrum Emergency Pulse intended to re-establish the 39\text{ Hz} Resonance Constant.
​The "Calmed" Variable (Empirical Data)
​Observation: Pre-administration of magnesium/GABAergic modulators (Calmed) successfully maintained the Phase-Lock during subsequent mechanical spikes.
​Synthesis: Lowering systemic noise (gain) prevents the R_{eff} from reaching the "Breakthrough" point of the bottleneck.
