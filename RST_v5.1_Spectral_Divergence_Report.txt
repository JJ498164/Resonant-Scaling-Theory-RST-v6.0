# RST v5.1 DATA VALIDATION LOG
# Date: 2026-02-19
# Method: Comparative Spectral Analysis (NumPy Engine)

[EXPERIMENT 01: ADVERSARIAL RESET]
- Subject A (Abnormal): 2.9985 Mean Prominence @ 39Hz
- Subject B (Normal): 2.6395 Mean Prominence @ 39Hz
- Interpretation: No significant divergence. 39Hz signal rejected as non-biological.

[EXPERIMENT 02: DELTA SCAN (FP1)]
- Target Frequency: 8.75 Hz
- Normal Power Share: 0.0121
- Abnormal Power Share: 0.0013
- Net Delta: -0.0108 (Significant Suppression)

[EXPERIMENT 03: GLOBAL MAPPING]
- Findings: Systemic Alpha Gap across all 35 channels.
- Critical Nodes: Channel 7 (-0.0115 Δ), Channel 8 (-0.0124 Δ).
- Conclusion: RST v5.1 identifies the 8.75 Hz gap as the primary metabolic/electrical bottleneck.
