# RST v6.0: Comparative Framework Analysis

| Theory | Focus | RST v6.0 Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** | Measures $\Phi$ (Integration). | RST defines the *temporal limit* ($\lambda_2$) where $\Phi$ can no longer be sustained. |
| **Global Workspace Theory (GNW)** | Ignition and broadcasting. | RST models the "Ignition Delay" (6.1s) caused by topological friction. |
| **Kuramoto Oscillators** | Synchronization dynamics. | RST provides the structural "Graph Blueprint" that Kuramoto oscillators require to function. |

**Key Differentiation:** Unlike purely descriptive models, RST provides an *engineering path* for recovery by targeting specific "Bridge Nodes" identified by the Fiedler Vector.
