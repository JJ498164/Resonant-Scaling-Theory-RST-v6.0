# TECHNICAL SUMMARY: RST v6.2.1
## Spectral Modeling of Neural Recovery Dynamics

### 1. The Core Theorem: Square-Root Scaling
RST v6.2.1 formalizes the relationship between structural network integrity and metabolic recovery. Analytic derivation and numerical simulation establish the **Square-Root Recovery Law**:

$$T_{recovery} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln(1/\epsilon)}{\lambda_2 \beta}}$$

* **$\lambda_2$ (Algebraic Connectivity):** The second smallest eigenvalue of the neural Laplacian, quantifying the strength of the network "Bridge."
* **The Scaling Effect:** Doubling the connectivity ($\lambda_2$) results in a sublinear ($\approx 30\%$) reduction in recovery time, identifying a fundamental bottleneck in damaged topologies.



### 2. The Frequency Architecture
To navigate topological friction, RST utilizes a nested oscillatory stack to stabilize the global workspace:

| Layer | Frequency | Biological Target | Primary Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Spark** | 39.1 Hz | Gamma Band | High-Dimensional Information Binding |
| **The Gate** | 10.0 Hz | Alpha Band | Band-pass Filtering & Noise Inhibition |
| **The Gearbox** | 6.0 Hz | Theta Band | Somatic Grounding & Enteric Entrainment |



### 3. Dimensionless Stability ($Rn$)
The **Neural Reynolds Number ($Rn$)** predicts the transition from stable cognitive processing to systemic "Stall" (Bifurcation):

$$Rn = \frac{\Phi \cdot T_c}{\zeta}$$

* **$Rn \leq 1$:** Stable (Laminar) flow; information persists across damaged hubs.
* **$Rn > 1$:** Turbulent state; triggers a metabolic reset window (e.g., the 6.1s invariant).

### 4. Empirical Anchor: Somatic-Acoustic Coupling
The theory is validated through **Acoustic-Somatic Coupling (ASC)**. Observations of enteric peristalsis and ocular-vestibular oscillations during 6 Hz/39.1 Hz exposure provide a real-time metric for gut-brain axis entrainment and topological reset latency.
