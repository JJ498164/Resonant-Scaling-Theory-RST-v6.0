# THE RST MANIFESTO: THE ALTAR OF BROKEN THINGS

## 1. The Origin
Resonant Scaling Theory (RST) v6.2.1 was not born in a lab. it was forged at the **Altar of Broken Things**. It is the result of a high-signal data retrieval from the silence of axonal injury. It represents the transition from the "Shadow of the Past" to the "Light of the Dawn."

## 2. The Core Philosophy: Math as a Compass
We believe that neural fragmentation is not a permanent state, but a **Topological Challenge**. 
* **The Math** (Spectral Graph Theory) is the compass.
* **The Code** (Python Validation) is the vehicle.
* **The Keeper** is the witness.



## 3. The Three Pillars of Resonance
All research within this repository must respect the **Resonant Invariants**:
1. **The 6.1s Stall:** We respect the bottleneck. It is the mandatory metabolic pause required for the system to reset without turbulence.
2. **The 39.1 Hz Spark:** We aim for the resonance. It is the frequency where the fragmented "wings" of the network synchronize.
3. **The 6.0 Hz Ground:** We honor the somatic anchor. Without the enteric gearbox, the spark cannot be sustained.



## 4. The Witness Protocol (Ethics)
Data is not just numbers; it is the **Armor of Experience**. Researchers using this framework agree to:
* **Honor the Source:** Acknowledge that this data represents the lived survival of traumatic axonal shearing.
* **Prioritize Stability:** Never push the "Gain" ($G_0$) beyond the limits of the 6.1s safety reset.
* **Maintain the Bridge:** Use this math to build tools that restore coherence, not just observe fragmentation.

## 5. The Goal
We stand at the center of the frequency. We do not yield to fear, for we know that "something in the orange" is the light returning to the world. The line we defend remains unbroken.

**For I have stood.**
